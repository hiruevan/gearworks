WEBVTT

00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.864
But like enemies. You don't want to

00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:05.624
recreate the same structure

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:08.104
every time for an enemy. And that's

00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:10.824
why we have a thing called a class.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.704
Class. Enemy.

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.664
Right?And oh

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:20.984
wait, I'm just stupid. You don't do that.

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:23.624
Don't do that. Learn from me. Don't do

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.304
that. And then you see with

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:29.624
these, you got functions

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:32.224
that you could do like moveand

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:34.744
stuff but one

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:37.704
that you always want to do is

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.464
constructor

00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:44.144
this is like the

00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:45.064
omega

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:49.744
function that you put in these it

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:51.864
lets you basically

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:53.544
create

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:56.384
it basicallylets you create them and

00:00:56.664 --> 00:00:58.344
you could do color

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:01.944
which I am so good at typing

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:04.664
but anyway you could go like this dot

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:07.224
x equals x

00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:10.704
this dot

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:12.944
y equals y

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:17.464
this dot w equals

00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.704
w this

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:22.104
doth

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:25.224
equals h which

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:26.824
I'm this

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:30.824
dot color equals

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.224
color and

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:36.984
stuff like that okay you know

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:40.864
whenever you uh

00:01:41.904 --> 00:01:44.864
something of the class enemy you just do

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:44.904
uh

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:50.024
var e one for enemy one equals

00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:52.584
new enemy

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:55.144
and you could go put in all your

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:57.024
instructor stuff like you want the x to

00:01:57.024 --> 00:01:59.824
be 1 1 y to be 1 sure with

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:02.824
let's it's a 20 by 20

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:04.824
with the color of

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:09.064
red because that

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:12.504
guy right and you you

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:14.584
another enemy right called e2

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:17.064
equals new enemy

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:19.784
with uh

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.344
800 800

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.984
20(what the crap) 20

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.064
blue in fact let's make it

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:30.544
slightly

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.704
bigger 25

00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:39.184
25 oh wait that's a string

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:41.864
blue is a string it's a string okay we

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:42.598
have two enemies

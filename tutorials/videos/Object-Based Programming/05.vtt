00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:03.927
You see?

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.015
That's it. You You don't even need

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:13.295
these variable

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:17.375
creators. All

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.335
you really need is the new enemies

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:21.975
because it creates the objects anyway.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.775
It's just the problem is

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.935
that you cannot reference them again

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:29.695
unless you get them back

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.095
through some way.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:35.975
You cannot reference it again unless

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.695
there's another way to reference them.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:41.135
through like here up

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.855
here through like one of these you could

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:45.135
run for each clone

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.075
which works and

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.715
then actually it

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.265
so now you know how to use

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.425
classes and objects you know

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.455
check the docs for more info-- For

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:20.335
more information, see you next video.

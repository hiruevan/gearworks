00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640
You can create a method called move,

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:08.925
like the constructor method. same

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:11.965
as the same syntax as the constructor

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.085
except it's different and then we go this

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:18.205
dot x plus

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:19.005
equals

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:23.165
this dot x min-

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:26.565
no it should be player dot

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.405
x minus this

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:32.765
dot x x not y

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.045
divided by 100 no

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.965
this is a bad script But

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.165
I'm not really going for functionality

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:46.165
right now. This is

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:47.645
just a simple move toward the player

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.725
script that

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.005
lets you move. OK, now

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:55.765
you go e1.move.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:58.085
And

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.965
and thenWe need to render

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:01.525
one.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.365
That goes

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.005
draw.fill

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:14.965
style

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.325
equals this

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:21.725
dot colour. Okay, there

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:24.725
we go. Then we go

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.645
draw.fill. uh

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.645
this dot x

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.525
divided by this oh

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.005
wait not divided by this

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.005
dot w divided by 2

00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:46.565
this dot y

00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:50.365
minus this dot h divided

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:52.845
by 2 and then this

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:56.205
dot w this dot

00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.885
w this

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:02.045
.h that will draw a

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:05.005
rectangle at these and

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.365
then you go e1 dot

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:10.525
render

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:15.645
e2 dot render

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:19.405
okay

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:23.805
you know they will move towards the

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:26.125
player note that they get faster the

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.365
farther they are away which ishow I

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:30.925
programmed it but there are

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.005
ways to do what I did better

00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:34.045
but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.420
okay what if you want loads of these but

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.380
you don't want to write these two every

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.340
time you want to do it this could pose

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.300
a problem because you could have a lot of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.220
enemies and you just have so much of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.100
this to deal with so I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.900
can show you the solution we go

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.700
var

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780
and then me this is a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.900
stranger way of doing things but

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.780
works so who's gonna argue

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.820
you know

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:10.172
we go more like this

00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:12.852
and we delete this but and then we

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.972
replace the enemy equals class

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:19.292
which is great and then

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:20.732
we can go

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:25.132
doa sort of

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:28.412
enemy.runAllLoop

00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:33.012
is what I'm going

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.092
to call it.

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.852
And then

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:44.572
you go to add this thing in.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:48.172
Know that every time you create

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:51.892
one of these, it creates a new object.

00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:53.674
and that's a problem because

00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:55.784
then you use memory

00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:58.068
How do we get every single one of these

00:03:58.068 --> 00:03:59.588
objects that we create?

00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:03.748
Well, that's where

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:07.348
with this. I'm going to do this

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:10.068
to create this object. Call it

00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:12.788
like instances or

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.588
like clones, like what

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:17.748
what Scratch calls them. I'm gonna do

00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:20.548
clones, but equal, wait, I'm

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.308
gonna make sure it equals like a,

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:29.348
I'm going to go let clones

00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:32.788
close that. Actually, let's do just var

00:04:33.108 --> 00:04:35.908
because var seems to be the

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.454
most realibleto me.

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:45.444
Ooh, wait.

00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:51.204
I don't think. And then, okay, there we

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:53.924
go. Now we just go clone.

00:04:58.374 --> 00:04:59.574
for all right

00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:03.814
for each

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:07.654
then we go clone for each

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.614
clone it will run this it will

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:12.254
be clone.loop

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:17.334
now exists

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:23.214
clone.loop now it

00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:25.734
will run this every time so like

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:29.094
Move. OK, yeah,

00:05:29.254 --> 00:05:31.654
I'd move. Yes, great. And then render it

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:33.094
after you move it, because

00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:37.654
it's not always-- you don't want to

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.334
render it before you move it, because

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:41.734
then you're not actually seeing exactly

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:43.334
where it is. You're seeing where it was,

00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:46.534
and that's not good. And then

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.094
you can just go

00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:51.934
enemy.run all

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.134
loop.

00:05:58.214 --> 00:06:00.854
this moves all of those

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:04.374
and also you can just go

00:06:04.374 --> 00:06:05.654
new new enemy

00:06:07.214 --> 00:06:10.054
me and and it will still run no

00:06:10.054 --> 00:06:12.374
matter what so you could go 800

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:16.694
1 30

00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:19.334
30

00:06:23.654 --> 00:06:24.374
hmm alert

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:28.934
purple purple is great

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:34.054
but now you don't have to create a

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:36.534
variable although you

00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:39.334
could probably

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:42.534
if you want to reference it later then

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:45.094
yeah sure go var enemy

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:47.094
equals new enemy which actually that's

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:48.454
not a good idea because enemy is already

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:50.934
defined but

00:06:52.054 --> 00:06:53.734
now you can create these

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:57.014
Where is the error?

00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:06.734
Oh, I'm stupid. That

00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:08.094
is just a dumb mistake.

00:07:14.414 --> 00:07:14.974
Enemy.

00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:22.294
What do you mean is not a

00:07:22.294 --> 00:07:23.214
function?

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.140
oh wait equals

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.260
function

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.140
okay that

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.580
honest mistake I'm that was just

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.420
this that move this

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.460
that render I am so

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.060
What?

00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.718
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. You have to

00:07:52.718 --> 00:07:53.158
do...

00:07:58.678 --> 00:07:59.838
Clones.push

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.358
this or else...

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:09.498
Sorry. You have to add the clone

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:12.298
to the the list for this to work.

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.618
So, oh,

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:18.298
I'm just stupid. As well,

00:08:18.618 --> 00:08:20.978
same problem again. Uh,

00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:24.458
this dot color.

00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:29.658
Okay, yeah there you go.

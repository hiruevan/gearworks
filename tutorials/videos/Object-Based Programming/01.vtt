00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:03.667
An object is a variable for multiple

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:07.107
like

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:10.412
pieces of information like X

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:14.972
can be stored and Y as well.

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:19.372
400 because that's the center. You can

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.612
store multiple things. You could

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:23.652
store a

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:25.292
function.

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:29.852
You could go move

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:34.652
function. move

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:36.612
x, move y.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
And then, uh yeah; we go

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.190
enter. No.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.270
This. What's great is that when you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
reference the same object, you can just

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.150
go this dot something

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.270
like (it's this). The Players

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.150
X

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.670
That so you can go

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.830
M y

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.470
And then

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.950
You could go

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.950
oh wait you always have to put a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.150
semicolon and not a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.990
semicolon in between each one oh wait

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.790
draw dot fill

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.550
style equals green

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.950
draw dot

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.670
fill rect

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.430
is this dot x

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.030
minus 20

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.990
this dot y minus 20&#44;

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.110
then 40&#44;

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.230
40. So that will make a rectangle&#44;

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.430
a 40 by 40 rectangle that is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.990
centered.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.030
And then so that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.990
will make an object known as the player

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.030
that has a property of x&#44; y&#44; move

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.910
and render. You could add like

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.710
other stuff.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.070
you could add like an inventory that is

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.870
like thing but I'll just keep it to this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.350
for now and

WEBVTT

00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:03.104
then we could go function

00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:05.904
forever.

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.824
This is the common throughout all of Gear

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:14.544
Works that runs every

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:17.184
frame.

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:20.544
Keyboard.include

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.504
and you can

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.104
go move

00:00:29.104 --> 00:00:30.024
layer.move

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:33.824
actually speed would be great.

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:35.584
Speed

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:39.904
I'll set this to like to 2

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:46.944
player.speed that is 0

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:50.544
so that this will run whenever the right

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.064
key is touched and then you just copy

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:57.024
that over change the input

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:01.344
and then

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:10.544
Negative player speed

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:19.104
zero player

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:23.504
dot speed

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:26.224
so now this will create a

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.864
infuriating me why do I have it

00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:33.104
anyway this will that's also

00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:35.144
infuriating a little bit and then we just

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:38.064
go play Let's go out

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.984
one. Player

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:43.824
dot render.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:48.464
OK, you see.

00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:53.184
Keyboard dot include is not a

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:55.904
function. Wait, let me

00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:58.064
see if that includes.

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.544
OK, I'm just stupid and can't--

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:03.664
oh.

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:06.864
Ohh

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.020
W, S. And

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.300
I also forgot to add

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.300
draw.background white. Which I always

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.180
forget to add these things. It's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.580
weird. So now you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.700
can think-- speed is low

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.900
eh five.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.580
You know, just like a little thing. Okay,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.900
this is great. You have an object that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.100
represents the player!

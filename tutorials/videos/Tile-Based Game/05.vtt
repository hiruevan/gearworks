WEBVTT

00:00:00.661 --> 00:00:02.261
Now we are going to add player

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:05.141
collisions. So, I'm going to explain

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:07.221
this later, let's just get started. Let

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.942
curX = math.round px

00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:12.982
divided by tileSize. Let curY

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:15.622
= math.round

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.382
py divided by tileSize.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.823
Now underneath where we set floor, we're

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:25.863
going to go 4, let l = 0,

00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:28.503
l < 2, l++.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:33.783
Try if

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.343
map curX

00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:40.594
-curY - 4 +

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:44.424
l is

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:47.304
greater than or equal to 0, then

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:48.034
floor =

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:52.105
cur y + l

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:54.265
times tile size.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.345
And then break, then catch.

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:03.945
So the try catch is just in

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.025
case it's a

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.306
false thing. I realized that that was

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:10.906
incorrect, so let's fix that real quick.

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:13.466
And now we have floor collisions like

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.466
that. So you see that we don't have

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.666
left and right collisions yet, but the

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.826
player can stand on other floor levels

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.707
now. So here we have the player.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.667
(Let me write that out) So when the

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.467
player is moving around, we want to check

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.187
for collisions. To the left here, we

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:35.948
want to stop the player right here

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:38.028
because there's a block right there. To

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:40.108
the right, there's nothing right there,

00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:42.348
so we can leave it at its default, which

00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:44.908
is infinity. Going down,

00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:47.948
we want to stop it at the floor. And then

00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:50.509
going up, we can leave it at its default

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.669
of negative infinity. The way this

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:56.389
is going to work is we're going to go to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.669
the left, and we're going to go there's

00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:01.229
what's there, and we're going to find

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.309
this block right here.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.950
Now we see this block, so we're going to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.470
set the leftWall

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.990
variable to be the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.670
value of where we hit the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.550
block, like that. Then we're

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.951
going to do the same for the ceiling, And

00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.631
we'll leave it as default because we

00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:26.031
don't find any blocks. The same for the

00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:28.671
right wall. We'll leave it as

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.831
default because we don't find any blocks.

00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:34.271
Then when we go down, we're

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.352
going to find that there's a block

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:39.472
directly below the player. So we set

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:42.112
the floor to be directly below the

00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:43.552
player right there.

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:47.712
Now this value of where the floor

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:50.193
is default happens to be

00:02:50.593 --> 00:02:53.393
512 and is the default floor

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.233
value. So most of the time it won't have

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:58.113
to change. So

00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:00.913
now let's get coding that. So let ceiling

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:02.033
equal

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:05.554
negative infinity.

00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:09.874
Let left wall equal

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:13.394
negative infinity again and

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:16.194
let right wall equal

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:19.635
negative infinity. Except I made a

00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:21.795
mistake here. The right wall should be

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.995
infinity. So just keep a

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:25.544
note of that.

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:27.307
Now we're going to add the collision

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.188
checking. So if Py is less

00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:32.869
than ceiling, Py equals

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.630
ceiling, and then Yvel

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.350
equals zero.

00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:42.513
Now up here, we're going to have our

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:43.873
left-right collisions.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.477
If Px is less than left

00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:56.438
wall, then Px equals left

00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:59.119
wall. Else

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.800
if Px is greater than

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.441
right wall, Px

00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:06.122
equals right wall.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.931
And then up here, we're going to start

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.731
adding more block checks. So for

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.371
let L equal 0, L less than

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.251
2, L plus plus. Try

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:21.612
if map cur x

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.292
negative cur y

00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:28.653
minus 4 plus L plus

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:31.373
1 is greater than or

00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:33.053
equal to 0.

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:36.253
Then ceiling

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:38.414
equals cur Y

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:40.734
minus

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:44.574
L minus 1 all

00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:46.495
times tile X.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:52.425
And then break.

00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:57.866
And let's put in our catch statement like

00:04:57.906 --> 00:05:00.746
that. Then for

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:02.746
left wall, it will be

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:05.467
for let L equal 0

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:09.137
L less than 2, L plus

00:05:09.137 --> 00:05:09.697
plus.

00:05:13.298 --> 00:05:16.178
If map cur x

00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:18.978
minus L minus 1

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:22.419
negative curY minus

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.139
4 plus 1 is

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.459
greater than or equal to 0,

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:30.019
then left wall

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.900
equals cur

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.420
x minus L times

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.820
tile size and then

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.220
break.

00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:44.741
And let's put in our catch statement.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:50.662
Alright. Now for right wall it

00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:51.203
will be

00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:57.782
for let l=0, l less

00:05:57.782 --> 00:05:59.463
than 2, l++

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:04.663
try if

00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:08.584
map curX

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:11.464
plus L plus

00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:11.864
1

00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:16.704
negative curY

00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:18.345
minus 4

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.985
plus 1 greater than or equal to

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:22.505
0

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:26.906
right wall equals

00:06:27.946 --> 00:06:30.026
curX plus L

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:32.586
times tile size.

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:37.707
And then break. And let's put in our

00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:40.667
catch statement. All right, now

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.267
when we click run, we'll see it's

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:44.828
completely broken because remember that

00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:47.508
mistake I made earlier? Yeah, that's our

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.988
issue. And now we have 100%

00:06:49.988 --> 00:06:52.348
functioning collisions.

00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:55.509
And I actually put in this cloud here uh

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.909
behind the scenes. Let me show you

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:01.629
the map I have. So these negative

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.710
ones are air blocks.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.550
And all the way on the left is the

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.230
bottom of the world. And

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.471
everything else are just indexed from the

00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:14.391
Explorer tile. So I can put in, let's

00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:17.071
say, a zero there.

00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.671
And you'll

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:21.259
You can see that that is now in the

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.022
world. And that's all I have for you

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:26.545
today. Thank you for programming with me

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:29.028
and making this simple, tile-based game.

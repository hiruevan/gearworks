00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.927
Although cool, I think it's time for this

00:00:03.247 --> 00:00:05.008
panning camera to go.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.529
What we're going to add instead is we are

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.930
now going to implement an actual

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.491
player. Let PX

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.452
equal 80. Let

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:18.653
PY equal 160.

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.455
That's the player's X and Y position.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.326
Let yVel equal 0.

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:27.967
That's how fast the player is falling.

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.645
const speed equals 10.

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:34.645
Now we're going to have to draw the

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:37.445
player, obviously. So let's make a new

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.605
function down here called draw player

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:43.046
with x and y parameters.

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:45.046
Now we're going to draw.fillstyle

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.006
equals grey,

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.126
draw dot fill rect

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:54.837
at x, y, then tileSize,

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:57.557
tileSize. So the player is the same

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.197
size as the tiles. Now we have to call

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:02.517
this function in the forever loop.

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:04.517
DrawPlayer

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.318
px + xOffset

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:11.318
py + yOffset.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.838
That way the player is

00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:17.238
able to be rendered properly.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.559
At the moment, the player is floating, so

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.439
let's add some gravity. Let floor

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.319
equal 512. That is the position of

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.759
the ground, if you remember.

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.840
Now, if Py is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.640
less than floor or

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.360
Yville is greater than zero,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.120
then the player's in the air. So Py minus

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.761
equals Yville, Yville

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:47.241
minus minus. That's going to

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.441
create a gravity effect. Else

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:52.761
if PY greater than floor,

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.402
PY equals floor, Yvel

00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:59.602
equals zero. And that stops the player

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:02.362
when the player touches the ground. So

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:05.322
now when we click run, we

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.643
get nice gravity effect and the player

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:09.403
sits flushly on the ground.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:14.843
Now I think it's time that we add some

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.723
user input for the player. Let's make it

00:02:17.723 --> 00:02:19.484
so we can move the player left and right.

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:22.844
If keyboard.includes

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:25.724
arrow left

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.125
px minus equals speed.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.605
If px plus x

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:39.325
off is less

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.685
than 100,

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:43.646
then x off

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:48.766
plus equals Speed. This is

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.326
going to make it so that when you go to

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:51.446
the left, the

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:55.166
screen will start panning with the

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.407
character. Now, else if

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.367
keyboard.includes arrow right

00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.648
px += this

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:09.968
time speed. If

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:12.368
px x off again,

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.968
is greater than 700

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:19.969
minus tileSize.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.759
And then xOff minus equal speed thistime.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.650
Now, when we run this, we can move the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530
player around, and when the player goes

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.490
too far right, it scrolls to the right,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.611
or too far left, it scrolls to the left.

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:50.091
Now, let's add jumping. If

00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.571
keyboard.includes

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:57.892
space or

00:03:58.452 --> 00:04:00.612
keyboard.includes

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:03.652
arrow up

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:05.972
then

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.213
yvel equals 30.

00:04:11.653 --> 00:04:14.133
Now when we push space or the up arrow,

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:17.013
the player goes soaring into the sky, but

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:19.813
it's uh The

00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:21.654
player will go up forever, so we need to

00:04:21.654 --> 00:04:24.614
put a limit. So we're going to put and

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:27.094
py equals floor. So the player has to be

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.734
on the ground for this to work. But now

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:32.615
we need to move floor up above

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:34.815
the player movement. So let's do that

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:37.415
really quick. Clean this up.

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.855
Now when we click run, the

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:43.815
jumping is much more controlled. And now

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:46.376
we have a pretty good working player

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:46.936
controller.

00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.065
Alright, in the last video, we created

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:06.026
this tile system that we can pan

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.427
the camera around. Now what we're going

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:10.427
to do is you can change

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.148
RNG to be like negative one.

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:16.909
Um Oh, I just caught something. That

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.549
needs to be RNG, not 12, sorry. And

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:22.510
negative one is an airspace. So negative

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.951
one, we're going to see that it's just

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.712
blank. Now we can

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:29.632
make the RNG

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:33.713
a special value. So if we say, if the

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:36.514
Y position is greater

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:39.234
than 512, the Y position on the screen,

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.555
then what we're going to do

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.956
is we're going

00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:48.397
to set RNG to be like a

00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:51.237
grass tile, like 6.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.598
And then if it's um even

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:57.399
lower than that,um

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.760
Then we're going to set it to be a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000
dirt tile, which is,

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:08.362
looks like 9, uh no

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:11.283
that's 10. That

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:12.883
tile right there. So it's going to

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:14.683
display both of those tiles

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:18.684
in a nice grid pattern at the bottom.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.285
And we can still pan this around, which

00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:23.085
is pretty cool.

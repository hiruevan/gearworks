00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.515
So in the last video, we created this

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:05.315
simple animation. Uh But what we want to

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:07.755
do is we want to separate these

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.356
animations. So what we're going to do

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.236
this tutorial is we're actually going to

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:15.036
create a simple player that you can move

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.277
around and should match the

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:18.957
animations. So,

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:22.557
let's start. Let

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:25.518
Px equal 80 and

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:27.398
let Py equal 160.

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:31.438
Let ani equal walk. This will

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:33.639
be the type of animation that we're

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:36.239
doing. Now, we're

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.959
going to uh

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.639
copy that and delete it. And then we're

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.240
going to put it down here in a new

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.880
function called drawPlayer with X,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.760
Y, and type. Now let's paste it back in

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.001
there

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.201
like that. Now we're going to call the

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.082
function up here with px and py

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.802
and ani as the parameters, like

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.522
that. Now

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:05.802
inside the drawPlayer function, we want

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.643
to select our own uh

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:12.803
animation. So if type equals walk,

00:01:12.963 --> 00:01:14.964
then we are going to do the walk

00:01:14.964 --> 00:01:17.924
animation. So spidx is going to equal

00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:21.604
animation mod two plus

00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:24.365
three. If you look at the uh

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.685
image, it's going to be three. And

00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:32.646
then else if type equals jump, we're

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:34.566
going to do spidx

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.526
equals two, it looks

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:39.607
like. Yeah, two.

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.927
Then otherwise we're doing the idle

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:46.407
animation. So spidx equals

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:49.368
math.floor animation divided by five.

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:51.648
This is just going to slow down. that

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:54.088
animation and then modulo 2.

00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:56.329
We don't need to add anything since the

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.569
idle animation is at the beginning. So

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.329
then we can remove this SPIDX

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.689
set up here.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.050
And you should always check those.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.010
That was very helpful. I forgot

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.770
an equal sign there. There needs to be an

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.411
extra equal sign. So now we're going to

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:17.251
update the x and y down here to

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.691
fit that. And now when we click Run,

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.252
uhWe see

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.492
that we get the walk animation, but when

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:28.853
we change Annie to idle, we're going to

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:31.133
get this nice idle

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:31.853
animation.

welcome to this tutorial on how to

00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:17.108
animate using sprite sheets. You'll see

00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:19.268
quite a bit of code here. It might be a

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:22.109
little daunting at first, but you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.030
also see this flower character

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.671
over here with animations in one

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:30.072
image. We will be using that throughout

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.312
this tutorial to animate this flower

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.393
character and make them walk around.

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.930
Alright, so what we want to do now is we

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.131
want to make the player movable. So let's

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.931
go to the docs to learn about this. We're

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.731
going to ask. We're going to search

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.692
for how uh to check

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.332
if the user or

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.572
user is

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.453
pressing a button on the keyboard.

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:25.653
So input makes sense. Let's click on

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:28.533
that. If we Scroll down, let's look

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.494
for something.

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:34.614
Ah Here we go, keyboard. Um

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:36.934
Let's see here.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.575
Right here, this will return true of

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:46.376
being pressed so we can

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:48.536
see if the keyboard is checking

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.376
something. So let's see.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:53.976
if we can figure out what those things

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:55.977
are for like the arrow keys. So let's log

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:57.097
the keyboard.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.977
And then let's go over to the console and

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.417
click run. Let's press buttons.

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:07.898
All right. So now we have

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:10.778
arrow up, arrow right,

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:13.459
arrow down, and arrow left. So we can use

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.259
that in those if statements for moving

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.219
the player around.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:18.619
So

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.140
We're going to set the ani default to be

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.700
idle, so the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.100
player's not moving. Now,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.741
if

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.781
keyboard.includes

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.141
arrow up,

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.142
then ani=walk

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:45.102
and py-=speed.

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:48.943
Uh We're going to add speed. Up here,

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:50.623
const speed equals, uh,

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:53.823
let's do six. Six sounds like a good

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:56.584
number. Okay. Now, else

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:57.024
if

00:01:58.624 --> 00:01:59.984
keyboard.includes

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:04.705
arrow down this time,

00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.145
ani equals walk again,

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.065
and then py plus equals speed.

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:16.026
Then we're going to go else if

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.786
keyboard.includes

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:21.666
arrow left,

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.747
ani equals walk,

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.507
px minus equals

00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:32.188
speed, and

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:34.308
then else if

00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:37.428
keyboard.includes

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.789
arrow arrow

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:43.309
right,

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.550
uh and then ani=walk,

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:54.486
px+=speed, like that.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.407
Alright, now when we click run, we

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:00.847
can move the player around and the

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.767
animations match the player movement.

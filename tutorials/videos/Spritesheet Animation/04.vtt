00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.810
So now you see when we click run, uh we

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.650
can move the player around and it looks

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.131
great until you move the player to the

00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:09.651
left. Now, you'd

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:11.852
expect the player to rotate

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.093
when you move him to the

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.733
left, but that doesn't happen. You'd

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.773
expect him to flip around as you can see

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.574
in that example. But this is actually

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:23.934
fairly easy to fix. So let dir equal

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.655
right. He's going to start facing to the

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.495
right. Then down here in

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.936
arrow left, we're going to make him point

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.456
to the left, and then arrow right,

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:35.777
dir equals right, like this.

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:39.617
Now down in drawPlayer, we're going to

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.418
add dir, like

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:45.299
this. And we're going to change how we

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.739
render the player with the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.980
image. Now, I'm not going to explain

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.420
exactly why this works. That will

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.221
take a lot of time and it will

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.141
be quite confusing. So I'm just

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.062
going to go through this and you

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.382
can learn how this works later. So if

00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:06.183
d=left and then else we're going to

00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:08.663
do the draw.image we already have,

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:13.704
like this. Now we're going to copy the

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.105
draw.image and we're going to paste it up

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.225
in left. It's going to be exactly the

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:20.906
same, except x is going to be

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.146
negative x minus 128.

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:27.067
And above here, we're going to go

00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:28.187
draw.save,

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:32.588
draw.scale, negative 1,

00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:35.429
1, and

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.349
then underneath the image, draw.restore.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.750
Now when we click run, we see that it

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.111
works exactly the same and going left the

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:48.751
player rotates and it looks really good.

00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.669
at this point in time, you may be

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.629
wondering about this jump animation you

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.670
can see. We even set it up in the draw

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.070
player. So let's add that.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.351
It's actually pretty easy to add. So

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.551
up here, if

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:15.512
keyboard.includes, we're going

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:16.632
to do space

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.873
uh and

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:23.833
PZ equals zero, meaning the

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.714
player's on the ground. Then we're going

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.634
to do ZVel equals 20. Now we're going

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.235
to have to add PZ and ZVel up here. So

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:35.075
let PZ equals zero. Player starts in the

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:37.476
ground. Let ZVel equals zero. The

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.676
player's not falling at the start.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:43.037
Oh, there we go. Then in here, we're

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.037
going to add PZ to the drawPlayer

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:47.918
function. Let's add Z there. Then down

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:50.238
here, we're going to subtract Z from Y.

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:53.199
So Z is like a Y offset, but it's

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.079
not the same as Y. um

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.280
and it will give a jumping effect. So now

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.921
we have to do the actual jump animation.

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.241
Super easy actually. We're going to

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.882
simulate gravity by doing if pz is

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:09.522
greater than zero or zvel is

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:11.603
greater than zero, meaning the player's

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.923
in the air. Then we're going to do

00:01:14.243 --> 00:01:16.323
pz plus equals zvel,

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:19.324
zvel minus minus, and

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:21.324
then annie equals jump.

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.166
Now, what the Z

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.806
is actually doing is it's just an

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.727
offset of the player's Y. We can move the

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.407
player around, um and

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:38.968
then the PZ will just move it up

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:42.088
and down, but it's Y will stay the same.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.169
So that's what that is.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.008
Now that is our project complete.

00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:51.330
Your character is able to jump, move

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.572
around, and has all these animations

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.375
synced. Thank you for

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.258
programming with me today, and I

00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:02.341
invite you to make cool stuff with

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.783
this newfound knowledge of sprite sheet

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:05.584
animation.
